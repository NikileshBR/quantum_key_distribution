# quantum_key_distribution

This is a simulation of Quantum Key Distribution protocol - BBM92 with 3 nodes on a cloud sever acting as Alice, Bob and Eve. I haven't used any network simulator, instead I have simulated the communication through a quantum channel and a classical channel using TCP sockets and simulated the qubits using Qiskit.
